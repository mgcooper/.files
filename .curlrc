# this is what I think should be all that is needed, if anythign:
proxy = http://proxy01.pnl.gov:3128

# these are here as examples, but I was informed that username/pword should never be needed on pnnl. I am not sure if the certificate path is helpful, or the correct syntax e.g. ca vs ca_certificate
# proxy = http://coop558:uhp15OKS@proxy01.pnl.gov:3128
# proxy-user = "coop558:uhp15OKS"
# ca_certificate = ~/Library/Keychains/keychain_certificates.pem
# ca = ~/Library/Keychains/keychain_certificates.pem
# ca = /Users/coop558/.certificates/PNNL_Web_Proxy.cer
# ca_certificate=/Users/coop558/.certificates/PNNL_Web_Proxy.cer
