#  source vs ./
# ---------------
# 
# dot space script is the same as source script
# they both execute the script under the current shell
# ./ executes under a new shell

#   PROMPT

# 
# https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Bash/Prompt_customization for details on PS1, PS2, PS3, and PS4
# 
# export PS1='$PWD/\n mgc ~> '
# 
# I don't think export is needed for PS1 but either way this is set by updatePrompt in bashrc

#--------------------
#   locate database
#--------------------

# the 'locate' command needs to build a database of all the installed stuff, which needs to be updated periodically. to first build it, run: 
# sudo /usr/libexec/locate.updatedb
# to call updatedb directly i'd symlink it to usr/local/bin:
# cd /usr/local/bin
# ln -s /usr/libexec/locate.updatedb updatedb
#  or i could define an alias above, but the symlink is what was recommended
# note - some chatter online about the db breaking after homebrew updates
